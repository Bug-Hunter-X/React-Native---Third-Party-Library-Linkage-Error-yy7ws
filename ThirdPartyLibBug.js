This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly linked or configured within your React Native project. It can manifest as unexpected behavior, crashes, or build errors.  The underlying cause often lies in issues with native modules, incorrect dependency versions, or problems with the library's integration with the React Native environment. For instance, if you are using a mapping library which is not linked correctly with the project may result in this error.
