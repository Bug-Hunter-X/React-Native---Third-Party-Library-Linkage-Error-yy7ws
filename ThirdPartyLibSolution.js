The solution to this problem involves verifying proper library integration. First, confirm that the library is correctly installed and linked using the appropriate methods for your platform (Android and iOS).  Check your package.json file to ensure the library is listed in the dependencies. For native modules, manual linking might be needed. Refer to the library's documentation for detailed guidance.  Clean and rebuild your project to ensure no stale files interfere.  If you are using a package manager like Expo, follow Expo's guidelines for installing and linking libraries.  If the problem persists after these steps, check for conflicting dependencies or compatibility issues, and consider using a different version of the library or raising an issue with the library maintainers.
